### Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, with over 140,000 people dying annually. Each year approximately 795,000 people suffer from a stroke with nearly 75% of these occuring in people over the age of 65. High blood pressure is the most important risk factor for stroke [(Stroke Center)](http://www.strokecenter.org/patients/about-stroke/stroke-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%20140%2C000%20people%20die,and%20185%2C000%20are%20recurrent%20attacks.).

### Data & Project Overview

The data originated from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) repository for stroke prediction. There are 11 features that were recorded for 5110 observations. The goal for this project will be to explore the data and find any correlations between features and the response variable stroke that will allow us to engineer new features for the data. Using these features, we then want to fit a classification model that will be able to predict whether or not a person has had a stroke or not, and in the future to predict the probability of a
